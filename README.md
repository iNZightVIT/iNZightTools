Package consisting of a set of helper functions for doing data science
with *iNZight*. These functions are designed to work well with a
graphical user interface (GUI), but many\[1\] are functional for direct
use through *R*.

## Installation

The current release version is available on CRAN:

``` r
install.packages("iNZightTools")
```

The development version can be downloaded from GitHub:

``` r
remotes::install_github("iNZightVIT/iNZightTools@dev")
```

## Basic usage

The package itself doesnâ€™t have any one specific use, but the functions
can be broken down into various workflows.

``` r
library(iNZightTools)
```

### Data import

Importing data is done using the `smart_read()` function, which can read
CSV, Excel, Stata, SAS, RData, and a few other formats based on the file
extension.

``` r
data <- smart_read('https://inzight.nz/testdata/nhanes.csv')
str(data)
```
