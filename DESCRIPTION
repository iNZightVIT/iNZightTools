Description: Wrapper functions providing a simple, limited interface to
    more complex functions and code snippets. In many cases, the result
    includes a `code` attribute containing the tidyverse R code used
    to obtain the result. iNZightTools also contains a set of helper
    functions used by other iNZight packages (including itself).
