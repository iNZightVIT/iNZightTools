Description: The 'iNZightTools' package provides a suite of wrapper functions for common
    variable and dataset manipulation workflows, as well as some other more general helper functions
    used by 'iNZight', a graphical user interface providing easy exploration
    and visualisation of data for students of statistics.
    Additionally, many of the functions in this package return the 'tidyverse'
    code used to obtain the result in an effort to bridge the gap between GUI and coding.
